            <b> Michael Joseph Jackson</b> (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer,
            and
            philanthropist. <i> Known as the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural
                figures
                of
                the 20th century</i> . During his four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion,
            along
            with his
            publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across
            many
            music genres. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated street dance moves such as
            the
            <mark>moonwalk</mark> , which he named, as well as the robot.

        <h3>Early life and the Jackson 5 (1958–1975)</h3>
        <p>Michael Joseph Jackson[9][10] was born in Gary, Indiana, on August 29, 1958.[11][12] He was the eighth of ten
            children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on
            Jackson
            Street.[13][14] His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to
            be
            a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears.[15] She was a Jehovah's Witness.[16] His
            father,
            Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at US Steel and played guitar with a local
            rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income.[17][18] Joe's great-grandfather, July
            "Jack" Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man.[19]
            Michael
            grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon,
            and
            Randy).[17] A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.[20]</p>

    <p> <em>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Michael_Jackson">Death of Michael
                Jackson</a></em> </p>
    <p>On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before his concert residency was due to begin in London, with all
        concerts sold out, Jackson died from cardiac arrest, caused by a propofol and benzodiazepine overdose.[303][304]
        Conrad Murray, his personal physician, had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented
        mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22 pm Pacific time (19:22 UTC) and
        arrived three minutes later.[305][306] Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed.[307] Resuscitation
        efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and for more than an hour after Jackson's
        arrival there, but were unsuccessful,[308][309] and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26
        UTC).[310][311]</p>
